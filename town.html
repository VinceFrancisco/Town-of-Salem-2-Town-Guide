        <header><h2>All About Town</h2></header>
        <p>Town is considered as the good people in Town of Salem. Its win condition is to eliminate all evils, including the coven, apocalypse, and neutral killing faction. Neutral evils does not need to be eliminated to win as town, but they can still benefit from eliminating neutral evils to prevent the disruptions they may cause.</p>
        <p>As a town member, you need to have a last will to tell information about what happened or what you did during the nights. This information is important because it can be shared and discussed with other town members to find out who is evil. If you did nothing that night, you can simply put N/A or not write an entry for that specific night. In the example below, nothing happened to the player at Night 1 (N1) and N3, while at N2 and N4, they shot a target. At N4 they got roleblocked (RBED)</p>
        <code>#Vigilante
N2: Shooting 13
N4: Shooting 6 (RBED)
        </code>
        <p>Different town alignments can have different will formats and strategies and this webpage will discuss each alignment and role to help you understand how to play or act like town in Town of Salem 2.</p>
        <p>To get started here are the 5 alignments of town that you should claim (don't claim your exact role, claim your alignment only unless you are sure that there is no ritualist, conjurer, or doomsayer in the game) when people Vote you For Alignment (VFA):</p>
        <ul id="main_doc_bullets">
          <li>TPOW</li>
          <li>TI</li>
          <li>TP</li>
          <li>TK</li>
          <li>TS</li>
        <ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Town_Power_(TPOW)">
        <header><h2>Town Power (TPOW)</h2></header>
        <p>As the name suggests, TPOWs are the most powerful alignment in Town of Salem but TPOW roles are unique, which means that its impossible for there to be 2 jailors alive at the same time. It is however possible for a Jailor and Marshal to be alive at the same time because only the role is unique, not the alignment. TPOWs have the ability to influence the course of the game by gaining extra votes to regain town majority, and by eliminating evils through extra lynches and executions. TPOWs are usually easily provable and because of that, TPOWs are mostly trusted, and confirmed TPOWs should lead the town on what to do or who to vote.
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Jailor">
        <header><h3>Jailor</h3></header>
        <p>The jailor is a powerful role that can be used to gain information and eliminate opposing factions. A jailor would want to jail one person everyday to and ask them for their role and full will. If a person didn't give their role, has an contradictory will, counterclaims late in vfa(not applicable to all any)or claimed late in jail, this could be a telltale sign that they are evil and you shouldn't hesitate using your executions to eliminate them.</p>
        <p>A Jailor will should include who you jailed, their claim or alignment, and other noteworthy info like if a person claimed late. As with all roles, it should also include what happened to you at that night.</p>
        <code>#Jailor
N1: 4 TPOW claim (RBED and Poisoned)
N2: 14 BG claim but no will (exeing)(healed by barrier)
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Prosecutor">
        <header><h3>Prosecutor</h3></header>
        <p>A prosecutor (pros) can prosecute once per day to instantly eliminate a player. However, if the player prosecuted is town, you will be executed by the hangman. Using this ability will reveal your role to everyone. As prosecutor, you can use your ability to prove if you're in a 1f1(1f1 meaning one person's guilt will prove another one's innocence) or you can use your ability if two evils are outed so you can prosecute one and vote out the other.</p>
        <p>*Prosecutor doesn't have a night ability so it doesn't need a will but it's very important to include what happened to you at night. Refer to <a class="example" href="#All_About_Town">All About Town</a> section for an example.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Marshal">
        <header><h3>Marshal</h3></header>
        <p>The marshal (marsh) is a role that allows an extra lynch during the day. It's ability also grants its +1 vote during the tribunal so it can be used to regain majority as long as town is coordinated and fast votes an evil. Using this ability will reveal your role to everyone. It is your job as the Marshal to ensure that town is coordinate during the tribunal and you can do that by telling them who to vote before using your ability. The two main uses of a marshal is to eliminate 2 confirmed evils in one day, or to give town better chances to vote an evil when an apocalypse member transforms or when TT hunt begins.</p>
        <p>*Marshal doesn't have a night ability so it doesn't need a will but it's very important to include what happened to you at night. Refer to <a class="example" href="#All_About_Town">All About Town</a> section for an example.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Mayor">
        <header><h3>Mayor</h3></header>
        <p>The mayor can reveal themselves to everyone to get +2 votes permanently. A Mayor should hold off from revealing unless necessary, such as if they are in a 1f1 or town needs to regain vote majority. This is because revealed mayors can be a target for ritualist and doomsayer, and clerics cannot protect a revealed mayor.</p>
        <p>*Mayor doesn't have a night ability so it doesn't need a will but it's very important to include what happened to you at night. Refer to <a class="example" href="#All_About_Town">All About Town</a> section for an example.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Monarch">
        <header><h3>Monarch</h3></header>
        <p>The Monarch (mon) can knight a player, giving the knight +1 vote permanently. When a knighted player is alive, the Monarch recieves basic defense. Knighting revealed players such as TPOWs or confirmed players like a vigilante that shot an evil are often the best targets to knight since they are already confirmed and most likely leading the town to lynch evil players. When you are Knighting them, be sure to whisper them during the day that you Knighted them to quickly confirm yourself to them before the Knighted announcement shows up. It is not a good idea to knight without information, because it is possible that you knight an evil.</p>
        <p>Sample Will for Monarch:</p>
        <code>#Monarch 
          N2: knighting 9
          N3: knighting 14
